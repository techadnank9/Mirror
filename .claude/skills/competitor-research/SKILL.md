name: competitor-research
description: When the user wants to research competitors or a rival product in depth — who is behind them, how they are funded, what they sell, how they get traffic, what they are hiring for, and where they are spending. Also use when the user mentions "competitor research", "competitive intelligence", "competitor analysis", "research these competitors", "who are we up against", "what is this company doing", or names two or more rival products to compare. Input is one or more competitor names or domains; output is one profile per competitor and, for several, a comparison summary. Runs on Glasser (paid per call).

# Competitor research

This skill requires Glasser — one Key across many paid data providers. Install it first: https://glasser.ai/SKILL.md covers installation and use.

Use Glasser for all data acquisition here. Reach for another tool only when the Glasser catalog has no endpoint for what is needed.

## Inputs

- the competitors, by name or domain
- which dimensions matter (see the table below); the core set is the default
- the user's own product, optional — with it the report can say what the findings mean for them; without it the profiles stand alone and the "What this means" sections are omitted

If the user names their own product instead of competitors, the competitor set has to be settled before any research — a shortlist costs nothing, research on the wrong set does.

## Process

### 1. Resolve each competitor to one entity

For each name, establish the canonical domain, the operating entity, and whether it is independent, a subsidiary, or a renamed or acquired product. Names collide; do not guess between genuinely ambiguous candidates — every later call keys off this.

### 2. Choose the dimensions

Cost is competitors x dimensions, so do not run everything by default:

- **Core** — positioning, funding, team, hiring. Cheap, high signal.
- **On request** — traffic, SEO, ads, social, history. Expensive or estimate-based; run when the question needs them.

### 3. Collect, in parallel

Only step 1 is a dependency. Past it every competitor-and-dimension pair stands alone, so fan out as wide as the environment allows.

Settle the endpoint and its parameters once per dimension and apply the same choice to every competitor; different sources or limits make results incomparable.

If a dimension has no endpoint, or is priced beyond what the user agreed to, record it as missing and move on — never fill a gap from memory. An empty result is not a gap; no funding on record is itself a finding.

## Dimensions and where to look

The middle column is a search query, not a provider name — search the catalog rather than assume what it offers.

| Dimension | What to pull | Search the catalog for | Confirm in `inspect` |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | canonical domain, entity name, status | `company search by name`, `company enrichment domain` | whether an empty result is free; whether it is priced per lookup |
| **Positioning** | homepage, pricing, product and customer pages as markdown | `webpage scrape markdown` | per-page pricing; surcharge for JS rendering; whether a failed fetch is charged |
| **Funding** | rounds, amounts, dates, investors, total raised | `company enrichment funding`, `funding rounds company` | as-of date of the data; whether unfunded companies return empty and whether that is free |
| **Team** | founders, executives, backgrounds, headcount | `person search company`, `person enrichment`, `company employees` | priced per person or per query; the cap on results |
| **Hiring** | open roles, functions, locations, seniority, volume over time | `job postings company`, `jobs search company` | priced per posting or per query; how far back the history goes |
| **Traffic** | visits, trend over time | `website traffic analytics`, `traffic estimate domain` | almost always the most expensive row here — price it first; check whether the figure is measured or modelled |
| **Traffic mix** | channel split, referrers, geography | `traffic sources channels`, `referral traffic domain` | whether the breakdown costs extra beyond the totals |
| **SEO** | ranked organic keywords, positions, estimated value | `organic keywords domain`, `ranked keywords serp` | priced per keyword row — the `limit` is the cost dial here |
| **Ads** | active creatives, platforms, spend signals | `ad library advertiser`, `ads transparency search` | coverage varies by platform and region; check what is actually included before promising it |
| **Social** | profiles, follower counts, posting cadence, recent posts | `social profile lookup`, `company posts` | priced per profile or per post batch; the cap on recent posts |
| **History** | how the team and product got here — founding, launches, renames, pivots, acquisitions, past positioning | `news search company` over a date range, plus scrapes of about / changelog / press pages | whether a date range changes the price |

## Report format

One profile per competitor, and a summary when there is more than one. Keep the section order identical across profiles so they read side by side; where a dimension was not collected, drop the section and say so under Coverage.

### Profile

```markdown
# [Competitor] — Profile

**Domain**: [canonical domain] · **Entity**: [operating entity]
**Generated**: [date] · **Depth**: [core / full]

## At a glance
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Founded | |
| Headquarters | |
| Headcount | [estimate + trend] |
| Total raised | [amount, last round + date] |
| Est. monthly visits | |
| Organic keywords | |
| Open roles | |

## Positioning
**Value proposition**: [headline + subheadline]
**Audience**: [who the copy addresses]
**Angle**: [e.g. simplicity-first, enterprise-grade, all-in-one]
**Messaging themes**: [3–5, each with source page]

**Pricing**
| Tier | Price | Key inclusions |
|---|---|---|
Billing model, free tier or trial, notable quirks.

## Funding
| Round | Date | Amount | Lead / notable investors |
|---|---|---|---|

## Team
Founders and executives with background; headcount and its trend.

## Hiring
Open roles by function and location; volume over time; what the mix suggests
about where they are investing.

## Traffic
Visits and trend; channel mix; top geographies. Mark estimates as estimates.

## SEO
Top ranked keywords with positions; estimated organic value; top pages.

## Ads
Platforms active; creative themes; spend signals.

## Social
Profiles and follower counts; posting cadence; recent themes.

## History
Timeline — founding, launches, renames, pivots, acquisitions, past positioning.

## Strengths & weaknesses
Each point cites the section above it draws on.

## What this means for [your product]
Only when the user's product is known. Where they are stronger, where you
are, openings in their offering or positioning, and where they are gaining.

## Coverage & sources
| Dimension | Status | Provider / endpoint | As-of | Measured or estimated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
Missing dimensions with the reason: no endpoint, priced out, or empty result.
```

### Summary (several competitors)

```markdown
# Competitive landscape — [date]

## Overview
One paragraph on the field.

## Comparison
The At-a-glance metrics side by side, one column per competitor.

## Positioning map
Where each sits on the axes that matter for this question
(e.g. simple ↔ complex, cheap ↔ premium).

## Takeaways
3–5 observations, each traceable to a profile section.

## Gaps and opportunities
Where the field is underserved — relative to the user's product when known,
otherwise in general.
